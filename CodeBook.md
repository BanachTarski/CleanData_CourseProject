As described in the [course forums](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-004/forum/thread?thread_id=261), for all the variables, the data has been divided by its range (gyroscope, entropy, etc) to normalise it, so numerical values are unitless.

1. subject - a number 1-30 indicating the subject of the observation

2. activity - indicates the activity for the observation, from one of these 6 values:

        * WALKING
        
        * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
        
        * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        
        * SITTING

        * STANDING

        * LAYING
